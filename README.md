# Save Compatability

This mod will work with existing saves, but all of the resources will have to be purchased from traders or mined using my Quarry mod.
Always back up your saves before adding new mods as there is always the possibility for issues.

# Mod Compatability - Not tested for 1.0 but no logic has changed

**Architect Sense:** All floors are grouped together
**Combat Extended:** Metals are regrouped to be usable for weapon crafting
**Industrialisation:** Copper and Aluminium are usable in recipes
**Survivalist's Additions:** Forge/Crucible can be used to make alloys
No known issues yet, please report any issues
