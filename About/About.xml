Sorted the floors into four groups since that was requested in the original mod.

Save Compatability
This mod will work with existing saves, but all of the resources will have to be purchased from traders or mined using my Quarry mod.
Always back up your saves before adding new mods as there is always the possibility for issues.

Mod Compatability - Not tested for 1.0 but no logic has changed
Architect Sense: All floors are grouped together
Combat Extended: Metals are regrouped to be usable for weapon crafting
Industrialisation: Copper and Aluminium are usable in recipes
Survivalist's Additions: Forge/Crucible can be used to make alloys
No known issues yet, please report any issues
